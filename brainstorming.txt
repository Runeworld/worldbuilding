General Ideas / Brainstorming

---- GAMEPLAY / MECHANICS ----
Old-school RPG with in-depth mechanics but made more accessible for modern audience
replayability / specialist player characters
    to have specialist characters a variety of playstyles need to be feasible, for example:
        good / bad / neutral
        different combat styles
        stealth / guns blazing
        pacifist -> manipulating people into killing for you or avoiding deaths
            could also be through non-fatal combat -> paralysis, knock-outs, ...
        solo / party / faction -> politics / economy
tutorial is optional
decisions have weight / no save-scumming
ironman / hardcore
how do we cater to role-players and min-maxers?
    character generation choice: background and character questions or direct stat / skill distribution
    how is it balanced?
(almost) infinite progression? how to avoid stats becoming meaningless?

long-term vs short-term fatigue?
    you are tired from sprinting for 5 minutes straight but it's
    a different kind of fatigue from what you feel after studying for hours
    or working hard for weeks with little sleep or relaxation
